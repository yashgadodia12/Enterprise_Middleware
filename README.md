# Enterprise_Middleware
For my Enterprise Middleware coursework, I developed a Java application on OpenShift, leveraging PaaS for deployment and scalability. I built a booking system with JTA for transactions, Bean Validation, efficient data management, and RESTful APIs documented via Swagger, gaining hands-on experience in enterprise application development.
